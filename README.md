# Planito

MVP for a scheduling/calendar helper app. Easily create or edit recurring events (daily or weekly), and sync to your Google or device calendar of choice. [Download from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cerdenia.android.planito).

The app uses Android's Calendar Provider API so there are no user accounts or sign-ins involved.
